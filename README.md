## **Project Objectives**

In Singapore, resale prices of Housing Development Board (HDB) flats have been on the rise over the course of 2021. There is hence a need to analyse the factors that could possibly influence this increase in resale price.
This project aims to:
(a) perform prediction of HDB housing prices
(b) identify the most important features that contributed to the prediction.


## **Dataset**

The project makes use of publicly available data on HDB flat prices in Singapore, obtained from http://data.gov.sg on 5th August 2021. The original set of features have been modified and combined with other datasets to include more informative features that will enhance the rigour of the prediction task.
